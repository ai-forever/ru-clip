# ru-clip
### First multimodal model for Russian language

**ru-clip** is a multimodal model for obtaining images and text similarities + rearranging captions and images.

**ru-clip** (Russian Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training) builds on a large body of work on zero-shot transfer, natural language supervision, and multimodal learning. The idea of zero-data learning dates back over a decade but until recently was mostly studied in computer vision as a way of generalizing to unseen object categories. 

We show that the continuation of work on the pre-trained language models [ru-gpts](https://github.com/ai-forever/ru-gpts) with the addition of a new modality - images - is able to make the system stable and generalize complex categories beyond standard samples.

**Note! This is the prototype model of OpenAI CLIP's Russian version following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020).**

## Model description
We use ViT-B/32 Image Encoder and RuGPT3Small Text Encoder.
